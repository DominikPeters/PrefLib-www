Description: <p>The <a href="http://www.netflixprize.com/">Netflix Prize</a> was a competition devised by Netflix to improve the accuracy of its recommendation system.  To facilitate this Netflix released real ratings about movies from the users of the system.  Any set of movies can be transformed into an election via a process outlined by Mattei, Forshee, and Goldsmith (reference below). This is a new slice of the Netflix Prize Dataset containing only those 71,943 instances that do not contain a Condorcet Winner.</p><p>In order to not flood PrefLib we have bundled These are only available as a <b>.zip</b> file of <b>.soc</b> data.  The data in these zips correspond to the 3 and 4 set analysis performed in Nicholas Mattei's dissertation; each election has more than 350 votes and the 10 sets partition the complete Netflix dataset.  The large sets contain the 1777 movies with the most ratings while near is the 1777 movies with more than 100 reviews with the lowest standard deviations.</p>
